Javascript Hangman Game

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop a hangman game. SVG is
used to create the graphics, with javascript for selecting letters and
notifications.

This project was developed utlizing a tutorial by Brad Traversy. When possible
my code strays from the tutorial to practice the skills taught in the lesson.
